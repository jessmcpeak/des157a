            <p>In his article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, designer <a href="https://medium.com/@salim.ansari">Salim Ansari</a> discusses twenty do's and don'ts for making web forms easier for people to sucessfully fill out. These tips boil down to striking the balance between making relevant information available to people while also not overwhelming them â€” utilising visual cues to communicate as well as verbal. The key takeaway is to always be on the lookout for whether you're making form design choices just for aesthetics or if there is a communicative purpose behind it. In the future I could see myself using this article as a checklist for improving my forms. I wish the IRS would take some of Ansari's advice.</p>

            <p>When is comes to famous forms, <a href="https://neal.fun/password-game/">The Password Game</a> by <a href="https://nealagarwal.me/">Neal Agarwal</a> is one of the most iconic. Counter to Ansari's advice (but ultimately highlighting the importance of best practices), the game hinges on keeping the form's requirements hidden from the player. As the player fulfills the requirements, more and more increasingly absurd rules are revealed, creating an experience which echos Ansari's advice to put the easy questions first so people will become invested and be more likely to persevere with difficult tasks.</p>

                <h2>Overthinking Overlays</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-04-04">04/02/25</time>
            </div>

            <p>Overlays can be very powerful in UX design; they can reduce the number of pages and clicks the user has to perform to complete a task. However, they've gotten a bad rep over the years because they're often used for the wrong reasons and implemented carelessly.</p>

            <p>In order to avoid frustrating overlays that remind the user of pop-up ads, Kathryn Whitenton from the Nielsen Norman Group reccomends evaluating a potential overlay with six questions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Who is the intended audience? If you expect users on mobile, Whitenton reccomends to stay away from overlays entirely because they can obsure content and make pages unsusable if the overlay was created only with the desktop view in mind.</li>
                <li>What is the purpose? Overlays prompt the user to view content, complete a form, or make a decision. In all of these cases, the information and resulting action need to be simple and communicated concisely to the user. If the information or action is lengthy or complex, a separate page may be more user-friendly.</li>
                <li>When will the overlay appear? Whitenton reccomends not interrupting the user's flow with an overlay unless the information and action are urgent to the user's task, although putting an overlay at the beginning or end of a task flow can be alright since it is less of an interruption.</li>
                <li>Where will the overlay appear? Overlays should be centered horizontally and the top should be in the top half of the page to ensure visibility and limit scrolling across screen types.</li>
                <li>Why does this need to be an overlay? If you can't provide a satisfying user-centric answer, it's probably best to have it as a section within the current page or a separate page.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Thinking about visual thinking</h2>

            <p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">After reading 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> by Michael Gonchar, I think visual thinking and analysis is a promising method for teaching critical media consumption that is directly applicable to the highly visual media landscape that modern children (and adults) experience on a daily basis in the 21st century. I remember being in middle and early high school, being taught media literacy and analysis through my English classes, and I had a really hard time getting it. What eventually made it click was taking high school art classes, and realising through the metaphor of visual art how other forms of media are just as intentional, constructed, and persuasive.</p>
                
            <p><a href="https://matvoyce.tv/">Mat Voyce's portfolio page</a> is a highly visual introduction to his graphic and motion design work. One of the most interesting parts of the page is the Featured Work section, where the scroll interaction changes from a typical vertical scroll, to a 3D scroll effect on the z-axis. The parts of the page go from the background, to the midground, to the foreground, then past the viewer's field of view.</p>
