            <p>In his article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, designer <a href="https://medium.com/@salim.ansari">Salim Ansari</a> discusses twenty do's and don'ts for making web forms easier for people to sucessfully fill out. These tips boil down to striking the balance between making relevant information available to people while also not overwhelming them â€” utilising visual cues to communicate as well as verbal. The key takeaway is to always be on the lookout for whether you're making form design choices just for aesthetics or if there is a communicative purpose behind it. In the future I could see myself using this article as a checklist for improving my forms. I wish the IRS would take some of Ansari's advice.</p>
            <p>When is comes to famous forms, <a href="https://neal.fun/password-game/">The Password Game</a> by <a href="https://nealagarwal.me/">Neal Agarwal</a> is one of the most iconic. Counter to Ansari's advice (but ultimately highlighting the importance of best practices), the game's hinges on keeping the form's requirements hidden from the player. As the player fulfills the requirements, more and more increasingly absurd rules are revealed, creating an experience which echos Ansari's advice to put the easy questions first so people will become invested and be more likely to persevere with difficult tasks.</p>
